# Valid Anagram

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

## Example 1:

```ts
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```ts
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
```

## Constrains

- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
