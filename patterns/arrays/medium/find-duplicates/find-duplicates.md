# Find All Duplicates in an Array

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **at most twice**, return *an array of all the integers that appears* **twice**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only *constant* auxiliary space, excluding the space needed to store the output

**Follow up:** tba.

## Example 1:

```ts
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]
```

## Example 2:

```ts
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: [1]
```

## Example 3:

```ts
Input: nums = [1]
Output: []
```

## Constrains


- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- Each element in `nums` appears **once** or **twice**.
